## vhdl (including sim sources), constraints
### (coefficients source files?)

## coefficient files (if not tracking, check for where these get made)
## fyi: check for where these are even generated because
## I have no idea if they're generated in a subdirectory
## that is ignored.
!/**.coe

## core generator files (what are these?)
## (same as for coefficient files) fyi: check for where these are even generated because
## I have no idea if they're generated in a subdirectory
